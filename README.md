# 2025 Video Game Design

## Challenge
The goal was to  develop a kids game with 2 to 4 players and playable on one (1) screen and one (1) keyboard at a time.

## Solution
The video game is a derivation of tag where players try to pass on the role of being “it” to other players upon collision. The losing player is the one who is “it” when the timer runs out. The sole movement option for all players will be to swing around points that they can attach to with the grappling device. Players are expected to build angular momentum from swinging to quickly jump from point to point. When a player presses their assigned key, the player’s grappling device will attach to the nearest grappling point, allowing the player to swing on the point. When players release their key, they will detach from the grappling point, launching players in the trajectory’s current direction. Players can reverse direction by attaching to a point and waiting until they swing in the opposite direction and detach the grappling hook. The map has obstacles that the players can hit and by consequence, players will slow down or stop.
